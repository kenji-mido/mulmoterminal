# MulmoTerminal Guide (English)

**New here?** Opening a terminal, installing Node.js / Claude Code / git / gh on macOS and
Windows, the start command, and what to do when it doesn't work — **installing and launching
is one page**, written so someone who doesn't write code for a living still ends up with a
running grid. Already set up? `npx mulmoterminal@latest` is the whole thing.

> **[What's new in 4.4.0](v4.4.0.html)** — **every cell keeps its own right pane**, the Files pane can **open a document or a story in the Canvas without an agent**, your **claude.ai connectors work in the workspace** again, and the session list stops re-reading whole transcripts (8.7 s to 1 ms on a 2.1 GB project). The cell header's **path became a menu** and six permanent icons moved into it (as of 2026-08-04)
>
> **[What's new in 4.3.1](v4.3.1.html)** — the launcher's workspace chip is labelled **`WORKSPACE`** by its role rather than by its folder name, and the **git chip refreshes when you come back to the tab** instead of up to ten seconds later. Nothing to configure (as of 2026-08-04)
>
> **[What's new in 4.3.0](v4.3.0.html)** — the **workspace** reaches the same GUI tools however you start a terminal there, and the launcher **always offers it** as its first chip. The single-view GUI MCP server id is now **`mt`**, so tool names an agent sees are shorter. And an **Enter that confirms a Japanese IME candidate** stays with the IME, in the session note and in the terminal. Nothing to configure (as of 2026-08-04)
>
> **[What's new in 4.2.0](v4.2.0.html)** — a **self-hosted GitLab** works once you name it in `gitlabHosts`, the **Canvas and Tools panes** can take the whole terminal area, a new **worktree inherits its project's settings** one hue step off, and a terminal that stops taking input **repairs itself as you type** or says why it cannot. One key to configure (as of 2026-08-03)
>
> **[What's new in 4.1.1](v4.1.1.html)** — the header's **usage** figure stops sticking at `n/a` on machines where the TUI is slow to start, the phone's terminal returns **300 lines** of scrollback instead of one screenful, and GitLab worktrees get the **PR phase pill** and **⧉ Open PR** that GitHub ones already had. Nothing to configure (as of 2026-08-02)
>
> **[What's new in 4.0.0](v4.0.0.html)** — the **single terminal view is removed**: the grid is the app, focusing on one agent is zooming its cell, and the content surfaces get a **Collections** door in the toolbar. A **worktree now runs one agent session** and refuses a second. The Docker sandbox is gone (as of 2026-08-01)
>
> **Follow us on X** — new releases and features are announced **in Japanese** on X: [Singularity Society (@SingularitySoci)](https://x.com/SingularitySoci). That is where everything ships first, so [**follow @SingularitySoci**](https://x.com/SingularitySoci) to hear about it as it lands.

> **[❓ Frequently asked questions](faq.html)** — how it compares to VS Code, Cursor, tmux panes, Claude Squad and Conductor; **whether your existing Claude Code sessions carry over**; Windows; token cost. The things people ask before trying it
>
> **Something looks wrong?** Type `/mulmoterminal-bug-report` in any session. The bundled skill hears the symptom out, checks your **real** config and version to see whether it is configuration or by design, searches the existing issues — and only helps you file one if none of that explains it, with the environment collected and secrets masked.

> **Want to change something?** **Open an issue, not a pull request** — outside PRs are closed automatically, whatever their size. That is not a brush-off: the bug we cannot reach from our machines and the idea we have not had are exactly what we are short of. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/receptron/mulmoterminal/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Run a whole team of AI coding agents (Claude Code / Codex) in parallel, on one board** —
MulmoTerminal is the cockpit for that — a browser terminal, so it doesn't care which editor you use.

**Vibe coding with one agent needs nothing but a shell.** What this app is for is the moment you run
**parallel agents** and lose track of which one is waiting on you. The vocabulary is in the
[glossary](glossary.html). The headline features first.

## Highlights

### The grid — a cockpit for parallel agents

![A board of parallel AI-agent terminals](../images/grid-2x2.png)

One independent agent per cell. **Status colors** (working = blue / awaiting input = amber /
done-review = green ring) and an **attention sound** mean you pick up only the cells that call
you — no babysitting. → [Basics](basics.html)

### The cockpit roster — everyone's progress, one row each

![The cockpit roster — a summary list of every session beside one enlarged agent](../images/cockpit-roster.png)

Stay zoomed into one agent while a text list tracks **every session's AI summary, last
instruction, latest reply, and PR phase** (draft / CI fail / ready / merged …). This is the
main screen for running many agents. → [Basics](basics.html)

### Phone push & remote control — walk away, get called back

![Push notifications on a phone's lock screen](../images/push-lock-screen.jpg)

Finished and input-waiting turns send a **Web Push to your phone**; open the live screen there
and answer with one tap (**yes / no / continue**). → [Mobile notifications](notifications.html)

### Worktree isolation & one-click PRs

**Git worktrees** let several agents work the same repo without colliding — diff panel, commit,
push, and **Open PR**, all from the cell. → [Scenarios](scenarios.html)

### The GUI panel — a screen beside the terminal

The agent's tool calls render as **diagrams, forms, images, documents, and video/slides
(MulmoCast)**. Your agent hands you an interface, not just printed text. → [Feature reference](features.html)

### tmux persistence — sessions don't die

Sessions survive reloads, reconnects, and server restarts. Leave a long build running and come back.

## What people say after switching

> These are experiences reported by users who moved over from an IDE or a split terminal —
> not benchmarks, and not claims we measured. Your setup may differ.

### "It stopped eating my memory"

Keeping several agents apart by opening several IDE windows is expensive: each one brings its own
editor, language server, extensions and file watchers. One user reported a **64 GB machine
stuttering** under that load, and running smoothly after moving over — here the agents are PTYs on
a server and the UI is browser tabs.

### "I stopped answering the wrong agent"

Six panes of scrolling text look identical. Users have described **typing a reply into another
agent's terminal**, and losing track of what they had asked in the first place. As one put it, the
windows all look the same, so switching between them costs time just to work out what you are
looking at.

The problem isn't attention — it's that N identical panes means holding N contexts in your head.
Colour-coded state, a name badge and a per-directory colour move that onto the screen instead.

### "Watching many and reading one stopped being a trade-off"

Splitting a terminal six ways leaves every pane too small to read a long answer without constant
scrolling and resizing — one user described exactly that with a 4,000-character reply. So you
quietly accept worse reading every time you add an agent.

**Grid ↔ enlarge removes that.** Watch all of them, then blow one up and read it properly — the
cockpit roster keeps the rest in view as text while you do.

### "My existing sessions came with me"

Sessions resume as-is — same `claude --resume`, same transcripts. Point it at a directory you
already work in and your history is there. Nothing to migrate, nothing to redo. One user said this
alone made the switch worth it, having previously lost context to killed sessions.

---

**You don't need ten agents for this to pay off.** Users have reported the switch being worth it at
**one to three** parallel sessions. The wins above are about not losing track, not about running
more.

## Vibe-coding with AI agents — sound familiar?

As you run more and more terminals and AI agents (**Claude Code** / **Codex**)…

- 📊 you **lose track of which one is doing what** (their status)
- 📁 you can't tell **which directory** each is in
- 💭 even when you know the dir, **what did I even ask it?** (you forget the instruction)
- an agent **finishes and you don't notice** — it waits on you, or you wait on it
- 💥 close the tab or the terminal drops, and **the session is gone**
- 🌿 you want to check git or open a folder, but keep **typing commands for it**
- all you really wanted was to **work fast with the terminal as your hub** —

AI agents take minutes per task. Babysit one and your hands sit idle; add more and keeping track gets harder.
The bottleneck isn't the CPU or the terminal — it's **your attention**.

## Every one of these, handled

| The moment | In MulmoTerminal |
|---|---|
| Can't tell the **status** of many terminals | Lay them out in a grid; **status colors** (working = blue / awaiting input = amber / done-review = green ring) + a sound, at a glance (→ [Basics](basics.html)) |
| Don't know **which directory** | Each cell shows its dir, a **project name badge, and colors**. Color-code to tell them apart (→ [Config](config.html#per-dir)) |
| **Forget the instruction** | The cell header always shows the **latest instruction / what it's doing**; **Activity timeline** shows the **tool-call history** (→ [Feature reference](features.html)) |
| Want to **know it's done** | Input-waiting turns **amber**, a finished turn gets a **green ring**, both **play a sound** — plus a **Web Push to your phone** (→ [Mobile notifications](notifications.html)) |
| Want the **session to survive** | **tmux persistence** keeps it alive across reload, reconnect, and server restart |
| Open **git / a dir** quickly | A git status chip; open **the OS file manager (Finder/Explorer) / the in-app files / a PR** in one click |
| Work with the **terminal as the hub** | All of the above on top of a terminal, and **extend it to your workflow with a DSL** (→ [Config](config.html#header)) |

## The four pillars behind it

1. **Supervise** — the grid is a **cockpit for parallel agents**. Triage by status color + sound; step in only where you're needed.
2. **See** — each agent's **status, model, context, git, tool-call timeline, and cost**, at a glance. What each one is doing and where, always visible.
3. **Automate & investigate** — run scripts in one click (in a **spare cell** next to a running session); when one fails, **turn a wall of logs into a short AI diagnosis**.
4. **Extend (DSL)** — header buttons/chips, launchers, and per-project config via **a small DSL** — it fits any developer.

## Get started {#cli-tools}

If the [`claude`](https://claude.com/claude-code) CLI (Claude Code) runs on your machine and you have **Node ≥ 22.9**,
one command starts it:

```bash
npx mulmoterminal@latest    # opens http://localhost:34567
```

If that didn't work, or you don't know what to install in the first place, everything is on
