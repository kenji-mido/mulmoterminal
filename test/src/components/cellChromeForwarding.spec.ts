// buttons can raise but that object has no key for is dropped where nothing can see it: the
// button clicks, the grid's handler waits for something that never arrives, and typecheck is
// happy because an unlistened emit is legal Vue.
//
// That is not hypothetical. The collections button shipped in #1573 emitting `toggle-collections`
// while `cellChromeBinding` mapped four events and `GridCellEmits` declared five — so "Show this
// folder's collections" never once opened the pane, through a green suite that included a
// "forwards every chrome event" test whose list was TYPED BY HAND from the same wrong set.
//
// Hence: the expectation is DERIVED from the component's own declared emits. A new button is
// covered the day it is added, and a hand-maintained list cannot agree with itself into a
// second silent dead button.
