// #1094, stated once over every call site rather than per route.

// The origin check answers "which browser PAGE may drive this server". A browser sends NO Origin
// on a same-origin GET, so a GET judged by it can only refuse the honest page — which is why the
// rule (routes/same-origin-guard.ts) exempts safe methods. The exemption lived in the middleware
// only, so the two guards that sat on a GET asked the predicate directly and answered 403 to every
// page served from an operator-named LAN origin. The remaining per-route guards were fine only
// because every one of them happened to sit on a POST.
//
// So: an Express route may not read the Origin header itself. `requestOriginAllowed` is the
// per-route form, and it carries the exemption with it.
//
// Enforced by forbidding the READ rather than the call, which is what a route has to do first
// however it then reaches the predicate — a call-shaped pattern is evadable by nesting or by
// renaming the parameter, and this is not.

//                         exempt, and a browser always sends Origin on a handshake
