// A memo keyed by a file's (mtime, size), for a value folded out of an append-only input:
// it remembers where the last scan stopped, so a file that GREW costs only the bytes that were
// added. Purpose-built for session transcripts, whose `.jsonl` is append-only and can be hundreds
// of MB — re-reading and re-parsing one on every window focus / grid-cell refresh stalls the event
// loop, and re-reading FIFTY of them is what made the session list take 5 s (#1377).
//
// `size` guards the sub-millisecond case where a file is rewritten within the same mtime
// tick; together (mtime, size) is a cheap, good-enough freshness stamp (a full content hash
// would defeat the point — we're avoiding reading the file at all on a hit).

 *  Nothing is resumable when the file got SHORTER (truncated, or replaced by a shorter one), nor
 *  when it stayed the same length but was written again — a same-size rewrite is the case mtime
 *  catches here, mirroring how size catches a same-mtime rewrite. A file rewritten wholesale into
