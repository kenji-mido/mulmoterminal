// Building a session's summary from a stream of records instead of an array of them.
//
// `readSessionSummary` produced all seven fields in one pass over `parseJsonl(readFile(...))`,
// which is the pass that cannot run at all on a transcript past ~512 MB (#998). Each field was
// already a fold over the records — the only thing holding them together was the array.
//
// **No windows.** The first draft kept a tail of the last N records and read the "what happened
// recently" fields off it. That is wrong, and Codex caught the first instance: a turn has no
// bound — measured across the eight largest transcripts on this machine, the longest spans 3,615
// records — so a window silently drops a turn's early tool calls, then its prompt, then the reply
// and model that preceded a long run of tool results. Every field here therefore folds over every
// record, keeping only what it needs:
//
//   - counts and totals → running numbers
//   - "the newest X"    → the last X seen, replaced as it arrives
//   - the current turn  → reset on each user prompt (the rule already works that way)
//
// The state holds **no raw records**, which is what lets this fold be paused and RESUMED — kept
// beside the transcript and continued on what was appended rather than run again from the start
// (#1377 / #1386). It used to keep every user record, to pick the latest meaningful prompt out of
// them at the end, and the last assistant record, to read the model and context off it. Both are
// now resolved as they arrive, by the same functions that resolved them before — and both were
// unbounded: a transcript here holds 13,664 user records, and one of them can be megabytes.
//
// Every rule still lives in its `…FromParsed` function: each is fed a one-record or few-record
// window rather than reimplemented here.
