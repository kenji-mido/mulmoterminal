// What a new git worktree inherits from the project it was cut from (#1317).
//
// `git worktree add` produces a directory whose cell looks like an unrelated project: no colours,
// no name, no model, and last in the priority sort. This derives the worktree's own config from
// the parent's and writes it there.
//
// Written to `.mulmoterminal.local.json`, not to the shared file (#1436). That file is gitignored,
// so the worktree's `git status` stays clean — which matters more than tidiness, since `isDirty`
// reads that same status and `removeWorktree` would refuse to clean up a worktree whose only
// change we wrote ourselves. It also layers OVER a shared config the repository committed, which
// is what lets a project ship its own colours and still give each worktree its own shade.
//
// The input is a LOADED DirConfig, not the raw file. Every field of that has already been
// through the loader's zod validation, so what comes out here is valid by construction and
// needs no second pass — where re-parsing the raw JSON would have to restate the rules.
