// What a rate-limit probe's own terminal says about why it never answered (#1293).
//
// A probe that brings nothing back used to leave the reader with "the last check got no answer",
// which is true and useless: the reasons want completely different actions, and telling them apart
// cost a reporter a whole debugging session. The probe already HAS the evidence on its screen —
// this reads it.
//
// Only ONE cause is named, and that is deliberate. The trust dialog is recognised by the marker
// pty-scan.ts already matches against a live claude TUI; every other guess at a message ("log in
// again", "you are rate limited") would be a string nobody here has watched upstream emit, and a
// confidently wrong reason is worse than none. Everything else stays `unknown` and keeps its screen
// instead — see writeProbeScreen.
