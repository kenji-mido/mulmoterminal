 * than one showing a resumable row under a default name.
 *
 * `startedAt` picks the candidates and the transcript's mtime then orders them, so a conversation
 * started long ago but resumed yesterday can fall outside the window once a single directory holds
 * more than `SCAN_LIMIT` of them. That is the trade codex makes too (it bounds by the timestamp in
 * the rollout filename): nothing here can order by recency without reading, and the log grows
