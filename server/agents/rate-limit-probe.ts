// The hidden Claude session that harvests the rate-limit windows (#387).
//
// It exists because the windows are only ever handed to a `statusLine` command, and only by an
// INTERACTIVE session that has had at least one API response — both measured. So the probe is a
// real `claude` PTY that is asked one trivial question, reports through the statusLine, and is
// killed. Nobody ever sees its terminal, which is what makes this cheaper than #388's design: that
// one injected the statusLine into the user's own cells and cost each of them a row.
//
// What it costs instead is one small query against the very budget it reports. That is the whole
// reason the caller only asks when a browser is watching (see rate-limit-store.ts) — a probe on a
// timer would spend the user's window overnight to refresh a number nobody is reading.

 * How the probe asks its question: as claude's own positional prompt, so the session submits it

 * It used to be typed — the prompt written 4 seconds after the spawn and a submit 800ms after that
 * — and the fixed wait is what made the gauge unfixable in some setups (#1293). A TUI that is not
 * accepting input yet DISCARDS the keystrokes: measured on a real pty, typing early leaves
 * `❯ replywiththesinglecharacter:.` in the box (the spaces swallowed too) with the Enter lost, so
 * nothing is ever asked, no API response happens, and the probe can only time out — then back off,
 * retry on the same fixed timings, and fail identically. Anything that slows a claude start past
 * that window (MCP connectors negotiating OAuth, plugin sync, a slow disk) makes the usage readout
 * permanently unavailable with nothing on screen to say why.
 *
 * Sending no keys also means the probe can no longer ANSWER anything: a blind Enter confirms the
 * default choice of whatever dialog is up, and in an untrusted directory that is "Yes, I trust this
 * folder" — verified writing `hasTrustDialogAccepted` for a directory nobody approved.
 *
 * `--strict-mcp-config` for the same reason as the prompt: the probe asks one question that needs
 * no tools, so loading the user's MCP servers (account connectors, plugins, `.mcp.json`) buys
 * nothing and costs startup time — measured at 8.0s to first windows without them and 9-15s with a
 * single unauthenticated one. It affects this hidden session only; the user's own sessions keep
 * every server they have configured.
