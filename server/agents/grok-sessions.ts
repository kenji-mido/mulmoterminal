// The encoding of that directory name is the silent failure mode of this whole file: get it wrong
// and the listing is simply empty, with nothing logged and nothing thrown. It is not re-derived
// here — `encodeGrokCwd` next door was measured against a real session and has a spec pinning the
// space / slash / non-ASCII cases.
