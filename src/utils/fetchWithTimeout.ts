// written the same AbortController + setTimeout by hand; this is that, once.
//
// The default is 8s because that is what the majority of those ten already chose for a plain API
// read. It is a default rather than a rule: the same ten also run 90s for an LLM summary and 300s
// for an upload, and a blanket value would break exactly those. Pass `timeout_ms` when the call is
// not an ordinary one, and say in a comment why the number is what it is.

    // finished in milliseconds. The alternative — proxying the Response so a body reader disarms
