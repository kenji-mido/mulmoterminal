// keystroke WITHOUT owning the field it was typed into: xterm's custom key handler and the grid's
// window-level shortcut listener.
//
// Those paths already refuse `event.isComposing`, which is correct on Chrome and Firefox. It is not
// enough on Safari, which fires `compositionend` BEFORE the confirming keydown — by then the flag is
// false, and the keystroke that was only meant to accept 変換 gets sent to the pty or run as a
// shortcut (#1353). The tracking that closes that gap needs composition events over time, which a
// pure `(keymap, event)` function cannot see, so it lives here and the call sites ask.
//
// Module-level rather than per-consumer: the two consumers must agree about one composition, and it
// belongs to the document, not to either of them.

  // set here suppresses EVERY later keystroke: no grid shortcuts and no terminal Enter, until the
  // page is reloaded. That is a worse failure than the one this module exists to prevent.
