// arriving at the same insertText().

// The bridge itself is the DROP upload (#993): a clipboard image is a File with no path, which
// is exactly what that route already takes. So this file decides only what a paste means; where
// the bytes go, how they are named, how big they may be and which directory the agent is allowed
// to read them from are answered once, in dropUpload.ts and session-drops.ts.
