// What the launch form can offer for the directory currently in its field: the sessions that can
// be resumed there, the script.json entries that can be run there, and the worktrees the
// repository already has. All three are re-read on every change to that field, which is what
// makes their two hazards one shared shape rather than three similar ones:
//
// - an answer for a directory the user has since typed their way off must not land under the new
//   directory's name, so each list carries a request token and drops a superseded response;
// - a read that fails clears the list, instead of leaving the previous directory's rows standing
//   under a name they don't belong to;
// - and the rows go the moment the directory changes rather than when the replacement lands
//   (`forget`), because until then they are the previous directory's — offered under the new
//   directory's name, and a click resumes exactly the session it says it will (#1372).
